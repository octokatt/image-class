title: Image I
date: 2019-03-03
format: notes
class: MeetUp Image Classification
---

Class Logistics:
-----------
* Run by Matt Borthwick at the PSU Accelerator
* Portland Data Science group
    - Data Discussion series, starting tomorrow, check it out
    - Previous main organizer has had to step down, now a new Main Organizer has stepped up
* New data sets are interesting, and handing them off is a helpful way to start this
* GOAL OF THE CLASS: Given a .jpeg, make an algorithm which craetes image segmentation, painted with an index, similar to the labeled .png
    - The first step is edge detection to break apart an image into classes of stuff
    - The second, harder step is to group the classes of object into useful segments


Things to Check out later:
----------
[ ] PDX Code Build, Tura.io, Megh Computing, APDM
[ ] Check out slack: portlanddata.slack.com 


Dataset intro:
-----------
<http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K>
This is the large data set, download at home
* Parts of the data are:
    - .JPEG is the original image
    - Segments are parted out in .PNG
    - Annotation is in .TXT
    - Index in .MAT
    - Small and Medium are subsamples is larger at 4GB
        + Full set is not compressed and is a lot larger
* Small version converted index to .csv
* Each semantic segment of a .png is labeled, color code is in the map
* Data set is manually colored and labeled, the colors for each image do *not* correspond to a larger set..?


Additional stuff:
------------
* Data set is Interested in human shaped objects
* Point of data set should be to try to classify objects, and hopefully identify different objects
* The data set should automatically capture and label the objects in the pictures
* Go for a supervised approach, which helps
    - Unsupervised approaches can be used, because this is to have fun :)
* REMEMBER: Label IDs start at 1, Python starts at 0, be wary of the off by one error
* Designing a loss function to show the difference between an ML classifier and a human classifier, and find the fuzzy things


Neat Libraries to Try:
----------
* Skikit-image
* ITK.org
* ants
* PIL --> can load in images, as well as in Skikit
* OpenCV <https://opencv.org>
* PCA, could be used to simplify the image from 10k pixel to 1k pixel (Dimensionality reduction)
    - You can also reduce from 10k to 1k colors, or even to a BW spectrum
* Mask-RCNN
    - More general image handling
* YOLO -- You Only Look Once
    - Image classifier
