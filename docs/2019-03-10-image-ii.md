This is an arbitrary notes page.

Honestly, I'm not sure where to begin, because Jupyter Notebooks, but I really like just having everything in Sublime Text like an adult.  A replicatable code build.

But, well, exploration is for Jupyter Notebooks.  So here we are.  Woo!

Current Project Plan:
==============

## Goal: Classify image parts to catch foreground parts via edge detection.

Project Parts (trial 1):
--------
[x] Download and set-up a data science repo
[x] Download the data set and descriptions
[x] Explore different package solutions for project
[x] RTFM
[ ] Load up the image set
[ ] Train an image classifier
[ ] Test the image classifier with the training set
[ ] Tweak the image classifier
[ ] Document the project


Project Part, Load up the image set:
-------
[x] Proof of concept to load one image
[x] Confirm can load one image from correct folder
[x] Create a list of the training images
[ ] Load the training images *as an ndarray*

[ ] Make image array smaller
[ ] Save the smaller image array
